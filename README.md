# occurring-odd-number-of-times-array

# Algorithm

Initialize a variable result to 0.

Iterate through each element num in the array.

Perform the XOR operation between result and num and store the result back in result. This can be done using the XOR operator ^ in most programming languages.

After iterating through all the elements, the value of result will be the number occurring an odd number of times in the array.

Return the value of result as the result of the algorithm.
